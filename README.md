# School_District_Analysis
##  An analysis made to compare reading and math scores for charter and public school. Data includes budget for all schools included.

We were given data in a CSV thast included, school information, student IDs, budgets, and math and reading scores for each student. The data was prepared by scanning for duplicates and removing them, removing any null values, and changing numerical values that were identified as strings to integer values. 

## The Schools included in the data were: 

* Montgomery High School    
* Green High School         
* Dixon High School         
* Wagner High School        
* Silva High School        
* Woods High School         
* Sullivan High School       
* Turner High School         
* Bowers High School         
* Fisher High School         
* Richard High School        
* Campos High School         
* Odonnell High School
* Campbell High School       
* Chang High School   

## Data Summary

Out of the 15 schools in the data 9 of them had a total number fo students under 1000. Montgomery High School had the most students with 2038 students with Green High school following closer behind at 1961 students. Chang High School had the least amount of total students at 171. 

In general, between grades 9-12, public schools seem to have close to $7,000 more in funding than charter schools.

Although public schools have a bit extra in funding, charter schools average higher reading and math scores. However the difference in averages is mostly minimal. I would not say there is too much of a direct correlation between school budget and student grades based on this information alone.

I believe a challenge with the included data is that there is no breakdown on budget allocation. It is a little difficult to compare funding and budget without knowing how the total budget is broken down within the functions of each school.
